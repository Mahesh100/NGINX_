# Start using Nginx as proxy to load balance the request to 3 different nginx webservers

In nginx.config file we have defined below code :

1) worker_processes 1;
  -These are basically called "Directives" , all key value configurations are called directives and here
   worker_processes is key and 1 is value.
  -
- More worker process we have in config file more is the request load nginx can handle.
- In production environment it is recommended to use worker_processes value to be equal to number of CPU cores that is
  available on server where nginx is running.
- We can also define worker_process auto ; value as "auto"
  auto= "Nginx will automatically detect the number of CPU cores available on server and starts the number of corresponding
  number of worker nodes.
